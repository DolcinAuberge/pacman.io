This project is about the character pacman, the objective
Of this project is to make the character move from one end of the screen to the other screen, and to turn to the opposite direction when it reached the end of the screen, and do the thing when it get to the other end. As the character is moving across the screen will open and shot itâ€™s mouth .
	I achieved this by considering four graphs of the character with two facing one direction and the other two facing the opposite direction, each set has one mouth open graph and the other one with mouth shut. I define a function that is tasked with the charge of taking the character from one position to the next with a frequency of 200 milliseconds that I set with the javascript build in method setInterval. I also define an other function named checkPageBounds that compare the position of the character with the width of the window to determine the boundary of the screen, and when the boundary has been reached, the checkPageBounds the return it the run function that then start moving the character to the next direction.
	This project  is still ongoing, in the future I will give more details about the project itself and how to download it.
